  These are resources.

  About Textures:
  You SHOULD define your textures in your shader, following these RULES:
  1 A texture cannot be used both in the VS and PS.
  2 The texture register numbers used in the VS or PS must be successive and start from 0.

  Tips:
  1 Textures in an XML material file are bound based on their written order, not names.
  2 If you ACTUALLY want to use a texture in both the VS and PS,
    you can define two in your shader and bind two in your material.
    only one texture will be loaded into memory for this.
  3 These rules seem complicated but are necessary to reduce the overheads
    of the root signature (one kind of DX12 object).
